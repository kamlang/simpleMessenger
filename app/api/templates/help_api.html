      <ul>
        <li><p> First you need to get your API access, this is done by creating a new OAuth client and give it authorization to access you data. You can create one by clicking on "Get Access" from the "API" menu above.</p>
        <li><p> Here the OAuth authorization code flow is used. Basically it means once you consent to give authorization to your newly created client you will get an authorization code in return which you can finally exchange to get your API token. </p>
        <li><p> Authorization token have a 1 hour life time. A refresh token which never expires is also provided, so you can request a fresh token without having to redo all the steps.</p>
          <li><p> You can then try it using either cURL, or this<a href="">Python CLI</a> which really makes it easy to interact with the API of simpleMessenger.</p>
